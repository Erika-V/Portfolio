After accepting her application for Fall 2017, she is set to graduate in the Spring of 2021 with a bachelors of science. Ever since she was a child, Erika had a passion for everything related to creativity and technology and it has stayed that way as she grew up. That is why she fell in love with adobe suit, specifically Photoshop and Illustrator. It combined the two things she wanted and inspired her to pursue other paths such as java script, HTML, and 3-D modeling.
                    During Erika's breaks she heads back home to Northern Virginia, where she works at her local vet and can see her family. She has a Maine Coon cat and a yellow Labrador at home also that she loves dearly. She's always had animals around her growing up and it is one of her favorite things to be welcomed back home from both. When Erika has free time she also likes going out to explore Washington DC and trying the food trucks in the mall area. The city usually has something going on at all times which makes the place entertaining.</p>
